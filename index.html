        <h1>Dixie Philamerah Atay</h1>
        <p>&quot;A lot of people say that morals are how we treat the people we know and ethics are how we treat the people we don&#39;t know. So morals are what make us a good parent, a good friend, a nice neighbor. But ethics are how we build a society. That&#39;s the true test of our higher self.&quot; - Henry McCord of Madam Secretary</p>

<p>Dixie is a dedicated developer. She began her professional career at Coding Avenue, Philippines as the direct counterpart to Illuminate Education's DnA team in US. She is primarily involve in problem-solving and implementing new features and improving the existing ones. Her exposure with DnA for the past 6 years of front-end and back-end implementations, reverse engineering, database and OOP design, and dealing all sorts of programmerâ€™s dilemma has encouraged her to be a visionary and a kind of programmer who hails awesomeness, with good intuition and would go the extra mile. Other than that, she learns from the best.</p>

<p>From the work that she did and still doing, she understands that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work should be rendered with sincerity since this values the people who will be affected by it. </li>
<li>There is always a reaction to every action. </li>
<li>Simplicity is always better. </li>
<li>Prioritizing is important. </li>
<li>There's a word compromise. </li>
</ul>
